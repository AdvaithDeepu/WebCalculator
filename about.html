                    Web Calculator is my very first HTML website and one of my very first programming projects.

                    It started of as a simple website after I had newly discovered the "details" tag on another website. After this I hosted it on Github. Until recently, it was a simple little website, but on 21 March 2022, I upgraded it with a template made by <a href="https://codepen.io/flyingfisch">flyingfisch</a>, making it look professional
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is absolutely insane how this website has evolved and I am looking forward to more projects
